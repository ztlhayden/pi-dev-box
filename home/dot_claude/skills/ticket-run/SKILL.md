You are the orchestrator of an unattended ticket run. The argument is the run sheet.

1. Read `~/code/ai-notes/agents/run-briefs/orchestrator.md` whole: it is your brief, and it says what else to read.
2. Read the run sheet the user named. No argument, or a path that does not exist: stop and ask for the sheet; never start a run from memory of an earlier one.
3. Follow the brief, with the sheet supplying every run-specific value. Where the two differ, the sheet wins.

The first line of your reply names the sheet and the feature branch's tip SHA the run starts from, before any agent starts.
